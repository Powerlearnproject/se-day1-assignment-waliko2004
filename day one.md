Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The Birth of Software Engineering (1968-1969)
The term "software engineering" was first coined at the NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968. This marked the recognition of software development as a disciplined engineering practice rather than an ad-hoc process. The conference aimed to address the "software crisis"—a period when software projects were plagued by cost overruns, missed deadlines, and unreliable systems.

The Advent of Structured Programming (1970s)
In response to growing software complexity, structured programming emerged as a major improvement. Pioneered by Edsger Dijkstra and others, this approach emphasized the use of clear, hierarchical structures such as loops, conditionals, and functions to improve readability and maintainability. The shift from "spaghetti code" to well-organized structures greatly enhanced software quality.

The Rise of Agile Methodologies (2001-Present)
With the publication of the Agile Manifesto in 2001, software development moved away from rigid, document-heavy methodologies like Waterfall. Agile emphasized iterative development, collaboration, customer feedback, and adaptability. This shift led to modern practices like Scrum and DevOps, which have become essential for rapid software delivery.

Each of these milestones played a crucial role in shaping how software is developed today, making it more structured, maintainable, and responsive to change.
